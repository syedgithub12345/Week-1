# Waste Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project is part of the **Week 1** milestone for the **Edunet Foundation Internship** in collaboration with AICTE & Shell. The task is to classify waste images into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. In this milestone, we completed the data preprocessing and initial setup for the project, including data visualization and the development of the base CNN model.

## Week 1 Summary

### Tasks Completed:
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Images were loaded and preprocessed from the provided dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized the distribution of waste categories (Organic vs Recyclable) in the dataset.
- **Model Setup**: Set up the initial stages for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from the following sources:
1. **Directly in the repository** (if included).
2. **Kaggle Dataset**: [Waste Classification Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data)

The dataset consists of images of waste items categorized as **Organic** and **Recyclable**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **TensorFlow** (for CNN model building)
- **Keras** (for deep learning layers)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **TQDM** (for progress bar)

## Installation

Since there is **no requirements.txt** file provided, manually install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pandas matplotlib tensorflow tqdm
```

Ensure that you're using **Python 3.10** or a compatible version of Python.

## How to Run

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - If the dataset is not already in the repository, download it from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the `dataset` directory.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `wasteclassification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Run all cells to load the data, visualize the distribution of waste categories, and prepare for model training.
